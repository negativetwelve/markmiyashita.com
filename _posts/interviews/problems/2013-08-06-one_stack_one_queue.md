Stacks and Queues are popular abstract data structures that represent fundamental ideas in programming and more specifically data structures. One popular interview question is to mimic the functionality of a queue using two stacks. This question takes that a step further by requiring the queue to be made out of a single stack. Recall what fundamental idea stacks are related to and this question will be a breeze.
